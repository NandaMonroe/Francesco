# Front-end-Project

This is my HTML, CSS, & JavaScript project for my 1st Stack in Web Fundamentals - Coding Dojo bootcamp

It is a restaurant's website, where you can find the menu, buy a gift card, make an order or make a reservation. 
It is very complete and has everything what this category of website needs.
